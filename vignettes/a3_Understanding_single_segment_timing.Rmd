This vignette delves into how the `tickTack` package obtains timing results for clonal peaks using the `fit` function. 
It explains the underlying processes, including the computation of clonal peaks and the Stan model used for inference.

## Key Components of the Analysis

The timing results are obtained in the following steps:

1. **Extracting clonal peaks**: Theoretical peaks in the Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) spectrum are calculated for specific karyotypes and tumor purity.
2. **Filtering mutations**: Mutations within confidence intervals around these peaks are selected for analysis.
3. **Fitting the model**: Bayesian inference is performed using a Stan model to estimate the timing of clonal expansions.

### Step 1: Calculating Clonal Peaks

The clonal peaks are calculated using the `get_clonal_peaks` function. The function computes the theoretical VAF peaks based on the karyotype and tumor purity.
They are computed using the following equation:

\[
\text{Peak}_i = \frac{M_i \cdot P}{(N_{\text{tot}} \cdot P) + 2 \cdot (1 - P)}
\]

Where:
- \( M_i \): The multiplicity of the allele of interest (e.g., the major allele or a single copy for heterozygosity).
- \( P \): The tumor purity (a value between 0 and 1).
- \( N_{\text{tot}} \): The total number of copies in the karyotype (e.g., sum of the major and minor alleles).
- \( 2 \): Accounts for the two copies in normal diploid cells.

#### Explanation

- The **numerator**, \( M_i \cdot P \), represents the contribution of the tumor cell's allele multiplicity adjusted for tumor purity.
- The **denominator**, \( (N_{\text{tot}} \cdot P) + 2 \cdot (1 - P) \), normalizes the peak to account for contributions from both tumor and normal diploid cells in the sample.

#### Example Calculation
For a karyotype \( k = "2:1" \) (major allele = 2, minor allele = 1) and tumor purity \( P = 0.4 \):

1. \( N_{\text{tot}} = 2 + 1 = 3 \).
2. Compute peaks for \( M_i = 1 \) (single allele) and \( M_i = 2 \) (major allele):
   \[
   \text{Peak}_1 = \frac{1 \cdot 0.4}{(3 \cdot 0.4) + 2 \cdot (1 - 0.4)} = \frac{0.4}{1.2 + 1.2} = 0.1667
   \]
   \[
   \text{Peak}_2 = \frac{2 \cdot 0.4}{(3 \cdot 0.4) + 2 \cdot (1 - 0.4)} = \frac{0.8}{1.2 + 1.2} = 0.3333
   \]

### Step 2: Filtering Mutations

Once the peaks are obtained, mutations within a genomic segment are filtered based on whether their VAF values fall within a confidence interval around these peaks.

The confidence intervals are computed using either:

- **Binomial distribution**: for standard VAF estimation
- **Beta-binomial distribution**: to account for overdispersion

#### Filtering logic

For each mutation, the number of variant reads (NV) is compared to the confidence interval calculated for the depth (DP) at each peak:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Example pseudo-code for filtering
probs <- c(alpha / 2, 1 - alpha / 2)
for (p in peaks) {
  quantiles <- qbinom(probs, DP, p) # or qbb for beta-binomial
  if (NV >= quantiles[1] && NV <= quantiles[2]) {
    # Mutation is accepted
  }
}
```

Only mutations passing this test are used for model fitting.

### Step 3: Bayesian Inference with Stan

The final step is to fit a Stan model to the filtered mutations. The model estimates the posterior distribution of `tau`, which represents the timing of clonal expansions.

The stan code used for the model is divided in the following pieces.

#### Data block

```{R, eval=FALSE}
data {
  int N;
  array[N] int NV;
  array[N] int DP;

  array[2] real peaks;
}
```

Here, the data block defines inputs that the model uses:

- **N**: Total number of mutations to analyze.
- **NV**: Number of variant reads observed for each mutation.
- **DP**: Total sequencing depth for each mutation.
- **peaks**: An array of two real values representing the theoretical clonal peaks (e.g., 2:1 and 2:2 ratios or other hypothesized clonal frequencies).

#### Parameters block

```{R, eval=FALSE}
parameters {
  simplex[2] omega;
}
```

The parameters block contains:

- **omega**: A vector representing the probability contributions of each theoretical peak. It follows a Dirichlet distribution (a standard approach for modeling probabilities that sum to 1).

#### Model block

```{R, eval=FALSE}
model {
  vector[2] contributions;

  omega ~ dirichlet(rep_vector(2.0, 2));
  
  for (i in 1:N) {
    for (k in 1:2) {
      contributions[k] = log(omega[k]) + binomial_lpmf(NV[i] | DP[i], peaks[k]);
    }
    target += log_sum_exp(contributions);
  }
}
```

The `model` block contains three components:

- **Prior**: The line `omega ~ dirichlet(rep_vector(2.0, 2));` applies a uniform Dirichlet prior to the karyotype mixture probabilities (omega). This means that we do not a priori favor one clonal peak over the other unless there is data evidence.
- **Likelihood**: The likelihood is computed using the `binomial_lpmf(NV[i] | DP[i], peaks[k])` (or the Negative binomial). This term computes the probability of observing `NV[i]` variant reads given sequencing depth `DP[i]` and a given theoretical clonal peak value `peaks[k]`.
- **Marginalization**: The line `log_sum_exp(contributions)` computes the log marginal likelihood by summing over possible contributions (karyotypes) using the softmax approach, allowing the model to integrate over possible karyotype contributions (`omega`).

### Final Step: Conversion from `omega` to `tau`

After fitting the Bayesian model, the posterior probabilities (`omega`) represent the contribution of theoretical clonal peaks. We convert these probabilities into clonal timing estimates (`tau`) using the following equations.

For `2:1` karyotypes:

\[
\tau = \frac{3\omega_2}{2\omega_2 + \omega_1}
\]

For `2:2` and `2:0` karyotypes:

\[
\tau = \frac{2\omega_2}{2\omega_2 + \omega_1}
\]
